<h1>Hello</h1>
<br>
Welcome to the first game I have created! A simple word-guess/hangman game for all to enjoy.

My game's theme is centered around your favorite robots from your favorite T.V. Shows. Simply guess the name of the robot to win the game.
<br>
<h3>Instrucitons</h3>
<br>
Step One: Take a look at the empty blank marks in the center of the page. Every blank spot represents a letter in the name. From there, guess the first letter. If the guess is correct the letter will appear in the coresponding blank(s). Guess wrong, you lose a chance, you'll have a total of 9 guesses per game.
<br>
Step Two: Keep guessing! try to fill in all the letters before you run out of chances.
<br>
Thats it! Pretty simple, even a rocket surgeon could figure it out.
<br>
Hope you enjoy!
